# Prospect Theory Rewetting Example

This repository contains a small NetLogo model demonstrating how farmers make
decisions about rewetting their land using Prospect Theory.

The file `result.ppm` is a simple image illustrating the outcome with the
model's default parameters. Each blue square represents a farmer who chooses to
rewet their land. With the provided starting values all 50 farmers rewet,
resulting in a completely blue grid.

To view the image, open `result.ppm` with any image viewer that supports the PPM
format (for instance, many modern image programs or even a web browser).
